				Love for you is a journey of discovery and growth. Every moment with you feels like a precious gift, and I cherish the way we laugh, share, and support each other through life's ups and downs. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your presence brings a sense of peace and warmth that words cannot fully capture. I admire your strength, your kindness, and the way you effortlessly make the world a better place just by being in it. You inspire me to be the best version of myself, and Mala mahit aahe tu kay read nahi karnar he efforts disnar rach kuthe tula majhe . With you, I've found a love that is pure, genuine, and unwavering, and I am committed to nurturing and cherishing this beautiful connection for all the days to come.
			<br>
			Love,
          	<br>Bhavani
